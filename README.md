## NBA-InMatch Application including MVC and API.
This is an application that consists in MVC and Rest API (developed in ASP .NET Core 8.0). 
To navigate the MVC you can just run the CS application.
To access API, SwaggerUI is recommended. (if you run the API from a local IDE, it will automatically run Swagger)

## Application
NBA-InMatch is accessing an external Rest API to obtain data from the NBA (Basketball league), and it exposes it in different pages. You 
can access player data, teams data and games data. You can even see the calendar for the current season, highlighting games that should still be played.
